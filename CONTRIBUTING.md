## Translations

Translations to other languages are highly encouraged. Each official translation will be held as a separate repository in the [MostlyAdequate organization](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate) and linked from the English version book.
Since each translation is a different repository, we can also have different maintainers for each project.

### Creating a new translation repo

In order to create a new translation, you need to follow these steps:

* Fork the [main repo](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide).
* Add yourself to the watch list of the main repo, to keep up with changes.
* When translating chapters, **create NEW files with suffix of your language**.
  * For example, Spanish tranlation for `ch1.md` will be on `ch1-es.md`.
* Open a [new issue](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide/issues/new) and ask to be part of the organization.
* Transfer the repo to the organization.
* Merge new content from the main repo.
* keep translating...
* Rinse/repeat last too steps until the book is done.
