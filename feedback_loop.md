# Seting up an immediate feedback loop

Clone the repo to a `local_folder`

```shell
  git clone https://github.com/DrBoolean/mostly-adequate-guide.git
```

change directory to the code folder in repository root
```shell
  cd /path/to/local_folder/mostly-adequate-guide/code/
```

install dependencies
```shell
  npm install
```

run the test runner with the spec file for that exercise, to see whats available
```shell
  npm run
```

this brings up the mocha test runner which shows the error immediately when you save the file with changed code. Achieve the requested refactor while keeping all the arrows green.
